# 2D Matrix Rotation

## Overview
This project contains a Python script to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation is done in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified without using additional space for another matrix.

## File
- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: Contains the implementation of the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.
- `main_0.py`: Demonstrates the use of the `rotate_2d_matrix` function.

## Function Prototype
```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

    Args:
        matrix (list of list of int): The 2D matrix to rotate.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in-place.
    """
